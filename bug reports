several issues require fixing...

major
*text replacement needs to catch additional references to the 'userbook' database and should be made flexible in case alternative names are used for databases.
*several of the pages need to be corrected to include host ip and userbook database name parameters as part of the login check
*template mysql file still needed for upload

minor
*additional feature requests still need to be addressed...
